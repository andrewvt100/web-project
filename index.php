						I am currently a Software Application Engineer at Workday. In June 2018, I graduated from the University of California, Davis with a degree in Computer Science. During my undergraduate education, I gained experience in software engineering through internships, developing OpenGL-based medical imaging applications in C++ and iOS applications in Swift. Additionally, I led a software project while at Stratovan, interfacing with customers to develop product roadmaps and make feature-development decisions.
